# Project LSTAT2185

## Authors
Mathieu Graf and Victor Dujardin

## Introduction
This project involves the application of numerical methods and bootstrap techniques to statistical problems. The main focus is on the analysis and optimization of a specific function using Taylor expansion and Newton's method.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to apply numerical methods to derive the Taylor expansion of a given function and to find the function's maximum using Newton's algorithm.

## Methods
- **Taylor Expansion**: Deriving the third-order Taylor expansion of the function \( f(x) = \frac{\exp(x)}{1+\exp(x)} \) around the point \( x = 0 \).
- **Newton's Method**: Implementation of Newton's method to find the maximum of the function.

## Results
The results include the Taylor expansion of the function and the outcome of applying Newton's method. (Please provide a summary of the results here or refer to a results file.)

## Instructions
To run the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your computer.
2. Open the RMD file in RStudio.
3. Install any required R packages.
4. Run the R code chunks sequentially to observe the results.

## Requirements
The project requires the following R libraries:
- (List any specific libraries used in the project, such as `tidyverse`, `knitr`, etc.)
